##  Apple Trainer

After training for Apple in multiple different Apple Stores I'm taking the experience I gained and going freelance to provide virtual and in home Apple Training. Send an email to: [jruckus@mac.com](mailto:jruckus@mac.com) and let me know what you'd like to learn about and I'll be more than happy to create a custom lesson.

### Training topics include:

- iCloud
- Apple Mail setup and organization
- Safari and Bookmarks/Favorites
- Saving Passwords
- Data protection and backing up
- Syncing with iPhone, iPad and Apple Watch
- Apple Photos, editing and organization
- Apple iMovie editing and video sharing



## RATES:
$50 per 1 hour virtual lesson. The first lesson includes a 15 minute setup to get the virtual training going over facetime/skype/google. 

All lessons are to be paid up front when lesson is scheduled.
