##  Apple Trainer

After training for Apple in multiple different Apple Stores I'm taking the experience and going freelance to provide virtual and in home Apple Training. Send an email to [jruckus@mac.com](jruckus@mac.com) and let me know what you'd like to learn about and I'll be more than happy to create a custom lesson.


## RATES:
$50 per 1 hour virtual lesson. The first lesson includes a 15 minute setup to get the virtual training going over facetime/skype/google. 

$75 per in person lesson. This can be conducted in a public place like your favorite coffee shop or in your own home. 

All lessons are to be paid up front when lesson is scheduled.
